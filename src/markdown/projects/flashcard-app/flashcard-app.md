Flashcard App was built as the first assignment of the Coder Academy Fast Track bootcamp. For the assignment, we were tasked to build a command line application in Ruby.

Flashcard App allows users to build, save and manage their own custom flashcard decks from the command line. These flashcards were then able to be reviewed in the same way that physical flashcards are used; users cycle through the cards and answered each card, with incorrect cards being placed aside for subsequent reviews. A score is tallied up and presented to the user afterwards.
