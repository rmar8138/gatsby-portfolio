PB Tracker is an application that allows users to sign in and create a log of their personal bests in various lifts, and track them visually on a graph over time. Users enter information through React, and the data is stored in Firebase's Realtime Database. This data is then pulled in and managed in state by Redux, and displayed using Chart.js

This was the first React application I built myself from scratch, and was what helped me get comfortable with the application design and development process through React and Redux.
