Hex Colour Memory Game is a game where players try to match cards until none are left. The cards are randomly generated using random hexadecimal colour values. The application is structured in an MVC pattern using IIFE's to hold private state and pass around data and functionality. The styles are made with custom CSS using Sass.

This was the first fully functional application that I built myself, and is the reason I developed a passion for web development. Visualising an end goal and reaching it through problem solving in face of all the bugs and mistakes made along the way really showed me how much I enjoy the process of coding.
