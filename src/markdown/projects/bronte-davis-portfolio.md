Bronte Davis is a photographer based in Sydney, Australia. This project was the final group assignment from the Coder Academy Fast Track Bootcamp. For the assignment, Cassie, Luke and I were required to source a real world client and build a project for them using the MERN stack. Bronte Davis needed a portfolio site where she could present her work, as well as manage and display blog posts from time to time.

Our group decided to build both a portfolio and admin front end as separate React applications, which both would connect to a single Express server which would handle Bronte's images and posts. Cassie handled the client-facing portfolio site while Luke and I tackled the admin dashboard and server. While we could have easily implemented a popular CMS solution, we wanted to challenge ourselves by creating one from scratch that had authentication and full CRUD resources.
