Culture Crawl is a two way marketplace that connects people who are passionate about discovering different cultures with people who are passionate about sharing their knowledge on these cultures. The project was the third major assignment of the Coder Academy Fast Track bootcamp, where we were tasked to built a two way marketplace using Ruby on Rails.

The concept of Culture Crawl was a platform where individuals, who were knowledgeable about certain cultural spheres such as music, design, art and architecture to name a few, would offer tours online. These tours are also known as 'crawls', which comes from the pub crawl culture.

Coming from a JavaScript/React background which emphasised configuration over convention, using Ruby on Rails for the first time to build a project was definitely a learning curve, but it exposed me to a different way of creating applications, as well as offering a very 'hands-free' approach to configuring a full stack application.
