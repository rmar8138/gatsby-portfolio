Ar-chive are a design studio based in Sydney, Australia and are comprised of Angela Tam and Rowland Reyes Martinez. Ar-chive were looking to build a portfolio site as a platform to display their work, mission statement and contact information, as well as increase online presence and attract potential clients.

As both Angela and Rowland have a keen discerning eye for a design, as well as a well-defined aesthetic for their brand, they were very set on the design and feel of the website. Being supplied detailed wireframes, mockups and notes, it was my task to translate their modern design into a workable portfolio site.

The biggest challenge for this project was translating a modern non-traditional website design into working code. Angela and Rowland had very creative and modern design ideas, and it really pushed my limits in regards to figuring out exactly how to use CSS and JavaScript in order to structure and style the website in a way that incorporated these elements.
