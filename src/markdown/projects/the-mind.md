The Mind is an application based off of the card game with the same name. Four players are dealt cards from a deck of 1-100. Without knowing each other's cards and making any verbal contact, the four players must play their cards in ascending order to win.

The Mind was built in order to challenge myself and learn more about Socket.IO and real-time bi-directional communication. React was used to handle user interactions and gameplay UI as well as hold game logic, Express and Socket.IO was used to contain the logic for transferring information in real-time between players, and MongoDB was used to store persistent data about rooms.
