Hi! My name is Ragan, a web developer from Sydney Australia.

Ever since I picked up HTML and CSS from Codecademy in early 2018 I've developed a passion for web development and coding. Since then I've been doing my best to learn as much as I can through online courses, articles, building my own projects and the occasional Stack Overflow search. I recently completed the Coder Academy Fast Track course and am currently interning at Faethm.

Being able to use logic and problem solving in endlessly creative ways is what drew me to web development, and is what keeps me excited and passionate about it.

When I'm not stuck in my laptop, you can probably find me playing [sleepy guitar music](https://raganmartinez.bandcamp.com/album/other-worlds), at a gig or playing pool with the boys.
