Hi! My name is Ragan, an aspiring web developer from Sydney Australia, and currently enrolled in the Coder Academy Fast Track bootcamp.

Ever since I picked up HTML and CSS from Codecademy in early 2018 I've developed a passion for web development and coding in general. Since then I've been doing my best to learn as much as I can through online courses, articles, building my own projects and the occasional Stack Overflow search.

Being able to use logic and problem solving in endlessly creative ways is what drew me to this field, and I hope to step foot in the tech industry soon.

When I'm not stuck in my laptop, you can probably find me playing sleepy guitar music, at a gig or playing pool with the boys.
